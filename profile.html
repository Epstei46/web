            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Coming into this boot camp, I had been looking into a career in Quality Assurance (QA) and how I would enter the field. I had been looking at some boot camps but was turned off by the prices, or them wanting like 15% of my salary (pre-tax) for 3 years.I was surprised to see the scholarship for this program that came at no cost to me, and was excited when I got accepted for the program.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">As I progress through the boot camp, I hope to learn more about coding and some of the other fields to consider. After picking my specialization and completing the boot camp, I hope to be able to quicky start my new career with a great job and team to work with (at Perficient, if my luck continues to hold up).</p>
